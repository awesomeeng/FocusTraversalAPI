# Focus Traversal API

We are always looking for people to get involved with the Focus Traversal API and proposal. Please consider helping us out in one of the following ways...

#### Spread the word!

[Tweet and Retweet](https://ctt.ac/H1IoF) about our proposal.

Make sure to use the hashtag [#FocusTraversalAPI](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23FocusTraversalAPI&src=typd)!

#### Comment on the Proposal.

You can comment in either the [WICG W3C Proposal Submission discourse](https://discourse.wicg.io/t/proposal-focus-traversal-api/3427), or the [WHATWG Github Issue](https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/4784). Even a thumbs up helps!

#### Download the Polyfill and use it

The more people [use the polyfill](./README.md#focus-traversal-api), the more issues we can find, and the more solid our proposal becomes.

You can get started using it today with npm!

```
npm install focus-traversal-api-polyfill
```

#### Participate

We need people to actively help us out, write test, make the proposal better.  Take a look at the [issues](https://github.com/awesomeeng/FocusTraversalAPI/issues) for an idea of where to get started!
